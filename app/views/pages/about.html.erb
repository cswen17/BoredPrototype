      <p class="core-subheading">Why?</p>
      <p class="event-modal-text-regular">
        In 2011, President Cohon posed a question to his student advisory
        council: is Carnegie Mellon fun? After some discussion, the students
        came to the conclusion that while there are a number of diverse
        interesting events on campus students just don't know about them:
        publicity and discovery are problems. Teudu was born as an answer:
        a highly visual, interactive, and most important, filterable,
        advertising medium.
      </p>

      <p class="core-subheading">Why advertise on Teudu?</p>
      <p class="event-modal-text-regular">
        Teudu provides an interactive Kinect environment installed on
        the fifth floor of the Gates-Hillman building. We present your
        events using a clean and modern interface that is highly visible
        to the entire student body. 
      <br><br>
        The web application you are viewing also provides a fast and
        simple way to peruse upcoming events as well as submit your own
        events.
      </p> 


      <p class="core-subheading">How can I submit my events?</p>
      <p class="event-modal-text-regular">
        Currently, only members of student organizations can add events
        to Teudu. If you are a member of a student organization and wish
        to have access to the Teudu system, please contact our

      Teudu is a free web application that is designed to help you
      organize and find out about events.  On the main page, you can
      filter the events in our database by date, time, and category.
      Then you can click on a specific event to view details about it.
      </p>

      <p class="core-subheading">Create an Event</p>
      <p class="event-modal-text-regular">
      You can also create your own event. By clicking on the New 
      Event link at the left of the page you can create an event
      with a variety of different characteristics, including the name,
      description, location, time and date, and the categories the
      event belongs to.  If you do decide to create an event, it will
      have to be approved by a moderator first, so it will not show up
      on the home page immediately.

        Teudu (pronounced "to do") is a highly visual, interactive,
        filterable, and most important, free app designed to help you
        organize and find out about events. On the main page, you can
        filter the events in our database by date/time or category.
        For categories, you can save your favorite category combinations
        as a category preference set and they will automatically be loaded
        as a tab when you visit Teudu's home page (web only). You can
        click on a specific event to view details about it.
      </p>
      <p class="core-subheading">Create an Event</p>
      <p class="event-modal-text-regular">
        You can also create an event by clicking on 'Create an Event' in
        the left menu and filling out the form on the resulting page. An
        event requires a name, start time, end time, location, description,
        and organization. You can associate your event with as many or as
        few categories as you'd like, though we recommend at least 1.
        All other fields are optional, but we also strongly recommend that
        you include a 512 x 288 flyer to visually show off your event!
        Acceptable extensions for the flyer image are .jpeg, .jpg, .gif,
        and .png.
      </p>
      <p class="event-modal-text-regular">
        Once you submit an event, it will require the approval of an
        organization leader before it can show up on Teudu's home page.
        To become an organization leader, register a new organization,
        report a bug on the website, or express interest in becoming
        a Teudu developer, e-mail the Teudu super-admin at
        <a href="mailto:teudu.acm@gmail.com">teudu.acm@gmail.com</a>.
        Thanks for visiting Teudu, and wish you a wonderful time!
        You're awesome!

        on the web app but also the Kinect, Android, and iOS apps. An
