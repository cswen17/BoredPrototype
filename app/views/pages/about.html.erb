    <p class="core-subheading">Why?</p>
    <p class="event-modal-text-regular">
      In 2011, President Cohon posed a question to his student advisory
      council: is Carnegie Mellon fun? After some discussion, the students
      came to the conclusion that while there are a number of diverse
      interesting events on campus students just don't know about them:
      publicity and discovery are problems. Teudu was born as an answer:
      a highly visual, interactive, and most important, filterable,
      advertising medium.
    </p>

    <p class="core-subheading">Why advertise on Teudu?</p>
    <p class="event-modal-text-regular">
      Teudu provides an interactive Kinect environment installed on
      the fifth floor of the Gates-Hillman building. We present your
      events using a clean and modern interface that is highly visible
      to the entire student body. 
    <br><br>
      The web application you are viewing also provides a fast and
      simple way to peruse upcoming events as well as submit your own
      events.
    </p> 


    <p class="core-subheading">How can I submit my events?</p>
    <p class="event-modal-text-regular">
      Currently, only members of student organizations can add events
      to Teudu. If you are a member of a student organization and wish
      to have access to the Teudu system, please contact our
