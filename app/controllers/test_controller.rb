  # Hey sorry, this controller was made to check my sanity while I was
  # trying to install CMU's shibboleth auth scheme. The instructions
  # kept saying that we could protect a file or a directory via apache's
  # /etc/apache2/httpd.conf file, so I wanted to make up a 'test' page
  # to protect via apache+shibboleth. So there's no teudu-related code
  # here at all, so remind me to delete this controller and its associated
  # view (views/test directory?) sometime in the near future. With any
  # luck, no one will ever have to see this message...
