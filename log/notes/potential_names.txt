Purlieu -- French for hangout, just to go along with the french roots of venue and because each event will be a hangout for a bunch of CMU students
Epicenter -- because that's where stuff happens
Hit List -- for the dangerous and edgy people, because you want to see which events you wanna hit first before partying later at Carnival.
Chronologize -- just to go along with the theme of planning your time and seizing the two short and fun-filled days of Carnival.
Envisage -- French for planning, again just going along with the theme of planning your day
