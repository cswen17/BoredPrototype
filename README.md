Teudu
===

This is the teudu webservice. It's based off of RoR 3.1.

Deploying
---

To deploy, ssh into our server and restart Apache2, as follows:

ssh root@teudu.andrew.cmu.edu
- Ask Connie, Vilcya, Stephanie, or Avesh for password

Go to web site directory (/var/www/teudu)
- cd /var/www/teudu

Pull from repo
- git pull origin master

bundle install --path vendor/bundle  

 Clean all assets
- bundle exec rake assets:clean
- bundle exec rake assets:precompile

Restart the server
- sudo /etc/init.d apache2 restart


Database
---

We test online with the app deployed to Heroku. Since Heroku uses Postgres instead of sqlite, you should run bundle install with the development context.
`bundle install --without production`

Adding new moderators
---
Open up rails console
- rails console production

If user does not already exist in system:
Save new user record in database
- c = User.new
- c = first_name = <user's first name>
- c = last_name = <user's last name>
- c = andrew_id = <user's andrew id>
- c = moderator = true
- c.save!

If user does already exist in system
Modify user's record in database
- c = User.find_by_andrew_id("<andrew id>")
- c = moderator = true
- c.save!
