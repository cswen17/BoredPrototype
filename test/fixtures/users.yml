# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below

one: 
  first_name: Joe
  last_name: User
  andrew_id: joeuser
  moderator: true

two: 
  first_name: Andrew
  last_name: Carnegie
  andrew_id: acarnegie
  moderator: false

# Include fixtures :users wherever you're testing a method
# that checks against current_user, so that the helper method
# current_user will find this admin user.
